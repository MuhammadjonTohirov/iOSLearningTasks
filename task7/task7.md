# TASK 7

1. Write a function named myFilter() for Array, Dictionary(by keys), Set.
Do not use native filter. 

2. Write a function named myMap() for Array, Dictionary(by values), Set.
Do not use native map.

3. Write a function named myReduce() for Array, Dictionary(ny values), Set. Reducer collect elements of collections by given operation and return it.
Do not use native reduce.

 4. Write a function named myFlatMap() using myReduce for Array, Dictionary(by values), Set.
myFlatMap ignores nil and map nested collections to single.
Do not use native flatMap.

5. Write a function named myEvery for Array, Dictionary(by values), Set. The function checks all elements by condition. If condition is true for all element, then return true, else return false.
It works like __AND__ condition operation

6. Write a function named mySome for Array, Dictionary(by values), Set. The function checks all elements by condition. If condition is false for all element, then return false, else return true.
It works like __OR__ condition operation.

7. Write a function named myChain() for Array, Dictionary(by values), Set. Chaining = myFlatMap + myFilter + myMap + myReduce.

8. Try to implement [Church Numerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_encoding); in Swift.
