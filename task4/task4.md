# TASK4
> ## Test these taks result with your task3 AssertEqual function.

1. You are given two numbers a and b. Compute the sum of a and b and create a string stored in a variable __namedformattedSum__ that contains the sum written like bellow:
```swift
For a = 2 and b = 5

formattedSum = "2 + 5 = 7"

For a = 12 and b = 19

formattedSum = "12 + 19 = 31"
```

2. You are given a string stored in the variable __aString__. Create new string named replacedString that contains the characters of the original
string with all the occurrences of the character "e" replaced by "#".

3. You are given a string stored in variable __aString__. Create a new string called reverse that contains the original string in reverse order.
4. Return __true__ if __aString__ is a palindrome, and __false__ otherwise. A palindrome is a string which reads the same backward or forward.
5. Print words from sentence.
6. Find long word from sentence.
7. Find the maximum value from __listOfNumbers__.
8. Reverse the order of the elements in __listOfNumbers__ without creating any additional arrays.
9. Sort the values in __listOfNumbers__ in descending order.
10. Return all the elements from __otherNumbers__ that appear in __listOfNumbers__. Donâ€™t print anything if __listOfNumbers andotherNumbers__ have no common elements.
11. Find and store the digits of __number__ from left to right in an array __digits__.
12. Create a list __unique__ with all the unique numbers from __listOfNumbers__.
