# TASK1
1.  Determine the number of seconds in a year and store the number in a variable named __secondInAYear__.
2. Your are given the width and height of a screen in pixels. Calculate the total number of pixels on the screen and store the result in a variable named __numberOfPixels__.
3. You are given the sum and the difference of two numbers. Find out the values of the original numbers and store them in variables __a__ and __b__.
4. Given two variable __a__ and __b__, swap their values. That is the new value of __a __will become the old value of __b__ and vice versa.
   > Solve with two way.
5. You are given a number __a__. Print the last digit of __a__.
6. You are given Rocky’s age in dog years. Print Rocky’s age in human years. You know that 1 human year is __7__ dog years.
7. Everyone hates solving word problems by hand so let’s make a program to solve them for us.
   __x__ years from now Alice will be __y__ times older than her brother Bob. Bob is __12__ years old. How many years does Alice have?
8. You have __x__ apples. Bob trades __3__ oranges for __5__ apples. He does not accept trades with cut fruit.
   * How many oranges can you get from Bob and how many apples will you have left?
   * The number of apples you will have left should be stored in a variable named apples.
   * The number of oranges you will have after the trade should be stored in a variable named oranges.
   
9. A class consists of __numberOfBoys__ boys and __numberOfGirls__ girls.
   Print the percentage of boys in the class followed by the percentage of girls in the class.
   The percentage should be printed rounded down to the nearest integer. For example **33.333333333333** will be printed as **33**.
10. __Raindrops__
	Convert a number to a string, the contents of which depend on the number's factors.
	* If the number has 3 as a factor, output 'Pling'.
	* If the number has 5 as a factor, output 'Plang'.
	* If the number has 7 as a factor, output 'Plong'.
	* If the number does not have 3, 5, or 7 as a factor, just pass the number's digits straight through.
	__*Examples*__
	* 28's factors are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28.
	* In raindrop-speak, this would be a simple "Plong".
	* 30's factors are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30.
	* In raindrop-speak, this would be a "PlingPlang".
	* 34 has four factors: 1, 2, 17, and 34.
	* In raindrop-speak, this would be "34".
