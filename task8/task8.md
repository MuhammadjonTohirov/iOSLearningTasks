# TASK 8

1. Create a Shape base class and derive from it Circle, Square and Rectangle. Shape should have two methods area() -> Float and perimeter() -> Float that both return 0. Implement the methods and add the necessary properties on Circle, Square and Rectangle.

2. Create the same classes from the first exercise, but this time make Shape a protocol.

3. Create a custom initializer for Circle, Square and Rectangle and create two instance of each one.

4. Add the instance created in the exercise above into an array shapes and use polymorphism to find out the total area and perimeter of the shapes.

5. Solve the exercise above using map and reduce. Implement your map and reduce with one loop.

6. Make shooting game with delegation. You have Shootable weapon(pistol, shotgun, ...), Targetable target(enemy, ...) __protocol__s and player __class__. Target has __life__ property. Player has weapon to shoot target. Each weapon differently damage target(__life__).
Add an __armor__ property to the target protocol and reduce the damage taken by the enemy.

7. Implement a __matrix__ structure with generics.

8. Implement a __chessboard__ class.
